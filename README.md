# Image Comparison Vector Model
Final project for the course cs466 Information Retrieval and Web Agents, Spring 2017. 

To run, simply call `perl main.prl`

This goal of this project was to present a potential solution to the issue of art-theft on the internet, which discourages many artists from posting their work online. Ideally to be used by art-hosting sites such as DeviantArt, Pixiv, and Flickr, this program would be able to automatically detect if the image had already been uploaded elsewhere by using image-similarity algorithms.

# About

This is a rather old project of mine I completed my sophomore spring of undergrad. It was a new experience in a lot of aspects; my first upper level course, my first experience with Perl, and my first time learning about and using vector models. Furthermore, I was basically going into the world of image processing completely blind. As such, the overall quality of this code isn't exactly great. However, it was the first, large-scale personal project of my own design, and I came away learning a lot from it.

I wanted this project to take everything I had learned during the course, which focused on vector models with text-based input, and apply it to images, where color was used as the input information. This project would ultimately prove to be my first, hands-on encounter on the difficulties of image processing; in particular, how computationally intensive image processing actually is, and how the slightest change in RGB values can drastically change similarity calculations.
